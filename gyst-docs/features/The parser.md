# Command name correction 
1. The cli should make sure that the names of each command is written in the right way without fixing it automatically.
2. Point 1 can be achieved by checking the wrong command name against a list of commands names searching for the similar name, then prompt the user with the right name, and if that was the right command they had in mind. 
# Required input prompting
If a required input was missing, prompt the user with it's name, type, and description, then ask for the missing input.
